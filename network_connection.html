            <ul>

                <li> Prepare Your Elevator Pitch: Have a concise introduction ready that highlights who you are, what
                    you do, and what you're looking for.</li>
                <li>Listen Actively: Show genuine interest in others by asking questions and listening attentively to
                    their responses.</li>
                <li>Follow Up: After meeting someone, send a personalized follow-up message to express your appreciation
                    and keep the conversation going.</li>
                <li>Leverage Social Media: Use platforms like LinkedIn to connect with professionals in your field, join
                    relevant groups, and share industry-related content.</li>
            </ul>

            <p> Subject: UMSI BSI Student Seeking Your Advice </p>
            <p> Dear Mr. Johnson,</p>
            <p> My name is Alexis, and I will be a senior in the UMSI BSI program at U-M this fall. I’m interested in
                learning more about careers in UX research, and I saw on LinkedIn that you currently work in UX Research
                at Google. As an alum, I know your perspective about your current role and the steps you took to get
                there would be very helpful. I would be happy to meet via phone or Zoom. I know this may be a busy time,
                so if we aren’t able to meet within the next two weeks, I’ll be sure to check back in to see if sometime
                later this summer would work better. </p>
            <p> Thank you so much, Alexis </p>

            <h3> Reaching out to an UMSI Alum </h3>
            <p> Subject: UMSI student seeking your advice </p>
            <p> Dear Ms. Ray, </p>
            <p> My name is Hanna, and I am a first-year student in the MSI program, concentrating on UX Design and Research. I found
                your profile on the UMSI LinkedIn alumni group. May I set up a Zoom call with you to discuss your experience with
                Booking.com? Your insights would be greatly appreciated, as I am now in the process of applying for an open UX
                internship position there. I recognize this may be a busy time for you, so if we are unable to connect by email I’ll
                try to reach you next week to see whether that is more convenient. </p>
            <p> Thank you so much, Hanna </p>

            <h3> Reaching out to someone you found on LinkedIn </h3>
            <p> Subject: Current Student Seeking Advice- Exploring Career Paths </p>

            <p> I am a first year UMSI student pursuing an MHI with a concentration in XXX. I am exploring a career in XXX at XXX
                and recently came across your LinkedIn profile – your career path and current job sound very interesting.Would you
                be willing to speak with me for 20-30 minutes about your career journey? As an alum of the school, your advice and
                insight would be valuable to my career exploration.I recognize this is a busy time, and I appreciate any time you
                may be able to offer for a phone meeting in the next few weeks. I’m also happy to come to you if it’s easier to meet
                for coffee (on me!). Please let me know if there is a time that fits your schedule. Thank you for your
                consideration.</p>
            <p> Thank you so much, Hanna </p>

            <h2>Informational Interviews using the TIARA Method </h2>
            <h3> Preparing for your Information Interview </h3>

            <h4> What is an Informational Interview? </h4>
            <p> An informational interview is an informal conversation with someone working in an area that interests you who will
                give you information and advice.</p>

            <h4> Be sure to prepare! </h4>
            <ul> 
                <li>Ask yourself (and have answers for) the “big” questions </li>
                <li> Research the person, company, and industry. </li>
                <li> Prepare questions to ask using the TIARA method</li>
            </ul>

            <h4> What is the TIARA method? </h4>
            <p> TIARA is a proven systematic approach to build likeability with other people and your guide for the Q&A portion of any informational interview.</p>
            <h5> T- Trends </h5>
            <ul>
                <li> Try to make trend questions specific to the company, industry or function for the person you are interviewing. </li>
                <li> Example: “How are changing consumer trends affecting your company’s products?”</li>
            </ul>
            <h5> I - Insights </h5>
            <ul>
                <li> Insight questions slowly bring the interview down to a personal level. Ask your interviewee about their specific experiences, day-to-day work, and career pathway.  </li>
                <li> Example: “What is the most challenging part of your job?” </li>
            </ul>
            <h5> A - Advice </h5>
            <ul>
                <li> Asking for advice brings the conversation back to you. </li>
                <li> Example: “What should I be doing right now to prepare myself for a career in this industry?” </li>
            </ul>
            <h5> R - Resources </h5>
            <ul>
                <li> Ask for tools, blogs, websites, and other resources that the interviewee can recommend. This begins to close your conversation while giving you reasons & opportunities to follow up with your interviewee later! </li>
                <li> Example: “What resources should I be looking at to learn more about this industry/function?”</li>
            </ul>
            <h5> A - Assignments </h5>
            <ul>
                <li> Asking “assignment” questions can give you another reason to follow up with your interviewee and show your dedication to the field. </li>
                <li> Example: “What kinds of projects seem to add the most value to your organization? I’d like to see if I can start doing that kind of work in my classes at UMSI.”</li>
            </ul>
